## 🕒 Per-Card Custom Timer

If you want a specific delay for a card:

1. Edit your note type.
2. Add a field named **`Timer`**.
3. For any card, set:
   - `10` → auto-show answer after 10 seconds  
   - `3.5` → after 3.5 seconds  
   - Leave blank → uses the default 6 seconds

If the **`Timer`** field is missing or empty, the add-on always uses **6 seconds**.

## 🔧 Enable / Disable

You can toggle the auto-answer feature anytime:

**Tools → Toggle Per-Card Auto Answer**

A message will confirm whether it’s ON or OFF.

---

## 📝 How It Works

- When the **question** side appears, a timer starts.
- If the user hasn’t revealed the answer yet, the add-on automatically shows it.
- Showing the answer manually or moving to the next card cancels the timer.

## ⚠️ Notes

- The add-on does *not* auto-advance to the next card (only auto-reveals).
- Works during normal reviews, **not** in card previews or the Browser.
